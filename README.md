CSC412_SpeechRecognition
=========================

> This is a simple webpage that allows voice-to-text and text-to-speech transformation using Google Web Speech API.

1. Task 1
    In Task 1, my website can monitor your speech rate and gives you revelant hint, like your speed should be faster or     slower.
    Also, It will display a line-graph at the bottom showing the vibration of your speech rate for every 30 second.

2. Task 2
    In Task 2, my website works as a automatic agent for a virtual technical company. It can say different content according to user's response.
    To keep the status, I designed a status tree to store the status according to user's response so that my system won't return to the begining if user say hello during his payment purchase.
    
3. Task 3
    In Task 3, my website implemented the Google's voice search function. That is, it can automatically search the content according to
    user's words.
